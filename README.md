# Sign Language Processing Playground

This playground is intended for ease of prototyping real-time sign language models.

[Visit the playground!](https://sign-language-processing.github.io/playground/)

It includes, as a basic first step, MediaPipe Holistic pose estimation, on top of which other predictions are performed:

- Sign language detection (Model based)
- SignWriting hand orientation (Rule based)
- SignWriting hand shape (Model based)
- Partial SignWriting non-manuals - eyebrows, eyes, mouthing (Model based)
