# Sign Language Processing Playground

This playground is intended for ease of prototyping real-time sign language models.

It includes, as a basic first step, MediaPipe Holistic pose estimation, on top of which other predictions are performed:
- SignWriting hand orientation and rotation

To be added:
- SignWriting handshape classification
- Sign language detection
